# Welcome

docs.peachpie.io is the home for PeachPie documentation for developers. Check out [get started](get-started) or more advanced topics like [.NET reference](net-reference) and [API reference](api-reference).

!!! tip "Migrate PHP code to .NET Core"
    The very first step is to get your PHP code running on .NET.
    Follow **[get started](get-started)** and **[PHP guide overview](php-guide)** topics to create project and to build it as a .NET library. This gets you introduction to **[MSBuild project file](php-guide/msbuild)**, migration tips, compatibility status and how to work with the project in Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code.

!!! tip ".NET interoperability reference"
    In order to benefit from PHP code built as a .NET library, take a look on how to connect C# project with PHP project. The section **[.NET reference](net-reference)** provides documentation on how to pass variables, pass objects, call methods, share session data, instantiate classes, extend classes etc. between C# and PHP.
    
!!! tip "API reference"
    The project provides a lot of internals that can be used to drive the PHP code life cycle or to implement your own high-performance extensions in .NET. Follow **[API reference](api-reference)** for more information.
    
!!! tip "Samples, Tutorials, Scenarios"
    See our **[scenarios](scenarios)** for real world use cases, specific code samples and hints on how you can benefit of the project.
